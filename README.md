<p align = 'center'> Currently being developed. Only gun that works is '!ak47'</p>

# To do
- Gun properties (such as damage, speed, gravity etc)
- Gun collision on blobs/doors
- Recheck Delta/Lerp on 60fps + uncapped
- Fix Rotation of the bullets (They 'randomly'(unsure) flip) 
- Possible new bullet sprite
- Bullet trails (Already in, not active, looks horrible)
- Do another round of optimzation checks
